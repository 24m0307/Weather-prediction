# 🌧️ Rain Prediction Web App

This project is a **Flask-based machine learning web application** that predicts whether it will rain today based on key weather parameters.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Users input basic weather conditions such as:
- **Precipitation** (in mm)
- **Maximum Temperature** (in °C)
- **Minimum Temperature** (in °C)
- **Wind Speed** (in km/h)

The app then predicts:  
✅ **"Yes, it will rain today"**  
❌ **"No, it will not rain today"**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- HTML + CSS (Jinja2 templating)
- Scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)
- Joblib or Pickle (for model serialization)
